## Observations

This is a list of the most harmonic non-trivial chords of size 3,
that is, the chords are sorted by the size of the relative periods.
The best approximation in terms of notes is included with C as the
staring note. Observe that the best approximation for 7/4 is off by
31% of a semitone(!) This indicates that there are harmonic patterns
that cannot be realized on a standard piano.
